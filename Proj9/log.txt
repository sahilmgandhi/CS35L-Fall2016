Partner: Kunjan Patel

Step 1: Installing open SHH
I first had to install openssh and did the following commands to get ssh and get the server/client:

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Step 2: I had to generate the ssh keys for my client, and did so by typing:

ssh-keygen        // The keys are saved into âˆ¼/.ssh/is_rsa and is saved in the format id_rsa.pub)

Step 3: I tried to find my IP by runing ipconfig, and then tried to ping my partner's IP address to check for validity.

ipconfig              // my IP was 10.97.85.106, his was 10.97.85.101
ping 10.97.85.101

Step 4: While my partner waited, I began to create the user on my machine so that my partner could ssh into that:

man useradd                               // to check the manual pages for useradd to use it properly
sudo useradd -d /home/kunjan -m kunjan1   // created the user kunjan1

cd /home/kunjan1/                         // verified that kunjan1 exists
sudo passwd kunjan1                       // created a password for kunjan1

cd /home/kunjan1/                         // go to the user I just created

sudo mkdir .ssh                           // created the ssh directory and changed the ownership + permission
sudo chown -R kunjan1 .ssh                // recursively change ownership to kunjan1
sudo chmod 700 .ssh                       // 700 = read, write, execute

Step 4: After my partner attempted to ssh, I disabled the password based authentication by running:

emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

And then changed the line "PasswordAuthentication -> yes" to being no. This way he could log in without using his 
password next time.

Step 5: Now after my partner did step 1-3 for me, I began doing some steps so I could log onto his machine with my 
username:

ssh-copy-id -i sahil1@10.97.85.101        // copied public key over the  server 
ssh-add                                   // added the private key to ssh-agent

Step 6: Now I can log on to his machine:

ssh sahil1@10.97.85.101

I  ran a few commands like "man chmod", and "mkdir SahilTest", and more to see that I was indeed able to log on to his 
computer and the changes stuck. He tried going to my user, and saw that the changes were there, so we knew it was 
successful!

I then took out Kunjan's read, write, and execute permissions for my user on his computer by running:

chmod o-rwwx "$HOME"

Now that user was only for me!! Additionally, I also tried running it with x-forwarding, by typing the following 
command, and also ran "firefox" to see that indeed, the firefox window popped up!:

ssh -X sahil1@10.97.85.101
firefox
