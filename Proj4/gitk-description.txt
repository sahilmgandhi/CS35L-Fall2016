The roles of the subwindows in the screenshot are as follows:

The top left window appears to be a GUI that describes the commits made by 
various individuals, and different merges over the history of this 
repository. We can only see the commit message in this gui. 

The top-middle window shows the authors of each commit, and it is in line 
with the gui in the top-left window (so a commit in the top-left window is 
associated with the author from the top-middle window).

Similarly, the top-right window shows the dates of each commit and they are 
in the same line as the corresponding commit from the top-left window, and 
the corresponding author from the top-middle window.

The top and bottom windows are seperated by a divider which allows you to 
search specific things like SHA1 ID, particular row number, the name of the 
commit, and other information about the repository to help narrow down your 
search.

On the bottom, you have two windows. Depending on whether you choose to 
press "Patch" or "Tree" in the middle divider, the contents of these two 
windows changes.

If you press Patch: Then the bottom left shows the Changelog of the commit 
as well as what the particular changes in the files were (like the diff 
output you would see when you make a change, with + and - to show what was 
removed and what was added). In the bottom right window, you see the name of 
the files that were changed

If you press Tree: Then the bototm left only shows the ChangeLog of the 
commit, and does NOT show you the changes to each file. BUT in the bottom 
right window, you now see the file structure of the tree at the time of the 
commit (so which directories were where and what was inside of them).
