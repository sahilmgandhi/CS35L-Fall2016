1) Touch hw4.txt

2) I used "cd diffutls-3.0" to go into the directory where I had the v3.0 
checked out, and then I used the command "git checkout v3.0" to make sure I 
checked out the right one. Then I used the command "git branch quote" to 
create a new branch for the homework assignment. I then used the command 
"git checkout quote" to checkout this new branch to use.

3) I ran the command, "patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt" to patch this new 
branch. For every file that was being patched, it asked me, "Reversed or 
previously applied patch detected! Assume -R [n]". I replied y to all of 
these (this meant that patch would try to revert the old patches). Then I 
ran the command again "patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt" and got the files to 
properly patch.

4) I learned about the Emacs "C-x 4 a" by reading about it on the interwebs.
This command is used to create a new entry in the change log for a file. 

5) I changed 6 different files (the .c files), so I wrote a small 
description of which files were changed, and what I did for each file. This 
was the content of my file:

2016-10-21  Sahil Manoj Gandhi  <gandhi@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

        * src/cmp.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/diff.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrope in comments.
        * src/diff3.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/dir.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/diff.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/util.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.

6) I added the files to my workspace by doing "git add ." and then doing 
"git commit -F ChangeLog" to commit my changes with the ChangeLog as my 
commit message. I could check that my commit actually worked by typing "git 
log" and it showed my most recent commit as being:

commit 5e7419b4368b103258cc206d929d6709296e92c4

    2016-10-21  Sahil Manoj Gandhi  <gandhi@lnxsrv02.seas.ucla.edu>

        * src/cmp.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/diff.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrope in comments.
        * src/diff3.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/dir.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/diff.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.
        * src/util.c - Changed ascii grave to apostrophe in comments.

7) I used the command "git format-patch -1 --stdout HEAD > 
formatted-patch.txt". I used "wc -l formatted-patch.txt" to see the amount 
of lines it contains, and it was 656 lines. 

8) I checked out v3.0 by running "git checkout v3.0" and then made a new 
temporary branch called "partner" by running "git checkout -b partner". Now 
I copied over my friend's file () to my system and then used the command 
"git am < formatted-patch.txt" to see if it worked. The output of that 
command was as followed:

git am < formatted-patch1.txt
Applying: 2016-10-21 Jonathan Michael Zaturensky <
zaturens@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

I then invoked the following commands:
./boostrap
./configure
./make
./make check

Now I used the following comppands to check whether his patch actually works:

src/diff . - -> this outputted the correct use of '-' rather than `-'
src/diff --help -> this also outputted the correct use of 'FILE1 FILE2' 
rather than `FILE1 FILE2'

9) I ran the command "make distdir" and after it ran for 20 seconds, I ran 
the command "cd diffutils-3.0.1-e5d4". Now I opened up the changelog here, 
and as expected the first few lines said the following:

2016-10-21  Jonathan Michael Zaturensky  <zaturens@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

        2016-10-21 Jonathan Michael Zaturensky <zaturens7
        @lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
                * src/util.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.
                * src/sdiff.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.
                * src/dir.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.
                * src/diff3.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.
                * src/diff.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.
                * src/cmp.c: Replaced all ` with ', excepted in commented 
                sections.

This is exactly what I expected, since the changelog should show the 
Jonathan's most recent changes (that was the patch that we applied).

I also had another partner, Adit Deshpande, and I repeated steps 8 and 9 
with his patch. I saw similar results and can confirm that his patch works 
as well. I gave my formatted-patch.txt files to both Adit and Jonathan so 
they could verify on their machines.

10) To get gitk to work on my windows machine, I first installed Xming to 
host an X server on my local machine. I then used the X11 form of putty to 
ssh into the lnxsrv02 and was able to go to the directory: "~eggert/src/gnu/
emacs" and execute the commmand "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk". This appropiately 
opened up the gui that was needed, and I was able to answer the questions. 
The rest of my work is in the screenshot and the gitk-description.txt file.
