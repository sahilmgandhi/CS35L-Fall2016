# CS35L-Fall2016

CS35L is a software construction lab that most first or second year CS/CSE students take at UCLA. In this class, we study a variety of programming languages like C, C++,
Bash Scripting, and Python and also learn about various linux based commands so that we can become more diverse programmers. The class is split into 10 different projects,
one for each week, and those have been added to this repository. Additionally, I have also added my notes and final preparation studies to this project for personal future
reference as well as to provide some insight for anyone who stumbles on this repository.
