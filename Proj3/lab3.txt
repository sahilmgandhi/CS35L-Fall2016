Lecture 4 -> Monday/Wednesday 4-6 PM

For the lab portion of this week's project (installing a small change to a 
big package), I have done the following:

1) First I grabbed CoreUtils7.6 by using the command:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Then I untar'ed and unzipped the utility by running: 
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz.

After this, I made a folder in this directory called CoreUtilsInstall:
mkdir CoreUtilsInstall

2) I read through the INSTALL file and the README (using nano to open the 
files), particulalry focusing on the --prefix flag. I ran the command:
./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/gandhi/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-7.6/
CoreUtilsInstall.
What this did was tell the configure command where to configure my fresh 
installation by giving it the appropiate directory/

Once this was done, I used "man make" to read about the make command, and 
then ran make followed by make install to make and install the coreutils.

3) To reproduce the bug on my own machine with the unmodified version of 
coreutils, I first exported my locale to US.UTF-8 by using: "export 
LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8". After this, I ran ls. However I forgot that this would 
actually run the ls command from /bin/ls. To use the ls that was actually in 
the coreutils, I used the command ./ls from the bin folder within 
coreutils-7.6 -> cd ~/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-7.6/CoreUtilsInstall/bin ./ls -l
Now I was able to see all the various files in this directory with the wrong 
date format (Year-Month-Date Hour:Minutes).
	An example of this wrong output is: 
	-rw-r--r-- 1 gandhi eeugrad 18192 2016-10-13 16:15 randline.py

4) The next step is to apply the patch to coreutils. I grabbed the correct 
code from the 35L website link and pasted it into a file that I made called 
patch_file (using touch patch_file to make the file, and nano patch_file to 
access it/paste the patch). I used the man page for match to see why the 
pnum was important (it has to deal with the patch file having directory/file 
names to be in the correct patch). I used the following command to patch it:
patch -p1 <patch_file.

5) Then I need to remake the utils, but I should NOT do make install since 
that would reinstall the files and overwrite the patch that I made.

Most of these commands did nothing. Only CC ls.o, CCLD   dir, CCLD   vdir, 
CCLD ls, GEN dir.1, GEN  vdir.1, and GEN ls.1  did anything since these were 
the places affected by modifying ls.c. The other commands was merely the 
program entering and exiting various directories immediately because there 
were no changes to remake, but it checked those places anyways.

6) I tested that the modified version of ls worked by running ./ls from the 
src directory within core utils. As expected, it now outputs in the format 
Month day Time or Monday day Year (just like we wanted). I made a new file 
by running "touch newFile.txt". After running the ls command, it now 
outputted the date as Oct 13 22:47 (the time I ran the command). I then ran 
command "touch -t 201401210959.30 testFile.txt" and re-ran ls. This time it 
outputted the date for testFile.txt to be Jan 21 2014 (no longer giving a 
time, but replacing that with a year instead).

Example for file recently changed:
-rw-r--r-- 1 gandhi eeugrad 10014650 Oct 13 22:30 newFile.txt
Example for file changed more than 1 year ago:
-rw-r--r-- 1 gandhi eeugrad 10014650 Jan 21 2014 newFile.txt

If I test with the old version of ls, I still get the buggy version which is:
-rw-r--r-- 1 gandhi eeugrad 10014650 2016-10-13 22:30 newFile.txt
